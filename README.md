KIEI-451 Winter 2021

This website allows users to log-in and find NFL players based on league leaders in key statstics last year. By selecting one position and one metric, a user can find who led in that category in 2019. For example, selecting "RB" and "Rushing Yards" would return the 2019 NFL RB leader in rushing yards. Users can add and remove players from their team to keep track of who they want to draft next year.
